          <h2>Return To Silent Hill</h2>
          <p>Return to Silent Hill is an upcoming psychological horror film directed by Christophe Gans from a screenplay he co-wrote with Sandra Vo-Anh and William Josef Schneider, and starring Jeremy Irvine and Hannah Emily Anderson. It is an adaptation of Silent Hill 2 and a reboot of the 2006-2012 film series. Gans, who had previously directed the 2006 film, and Victor Hadida became interested in revisiting the franchise after inheriting the film license from the late Samuel Hadida. Feeling that his sensibilities had changed over the years, Gans wanted to make a more modern and psychoanalytic Silent Hill film that was distinct from the style of the previous series.</p>
